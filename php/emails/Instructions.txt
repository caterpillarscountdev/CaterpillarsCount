A cron job named "email" that was set up using the OC program runs the file [https://caterpillarscount.unc.edu/php/emails/cron.php] once every minute.

[https://caterpillarscount.unc.edu/php/emails/cron.php] checks the current date and time to see if we should be sending out any emails.
If so, we send a maximum of 5 emails per call over the course of a couple hours or so so we don't run into timeout issues.
You can easily change these limits and timeframes using the variables at the top of the file if needed. You can also change the dates by adjusting the "if" statements near the bottom of the file.

When [https://caterpillarscount.unc.edu/php/emails/cron.php] calls functions like "email3" and "email4", it is calling these functions from [https://caterpillarscount.unc.edu/php/orm/mailing.php].
These functions the HTML strings that make up the custom emails. If you need to edit the HTML for any of these emails, follow these steps:
	1) Copy the HTML string (without encompassing quotations) into a text editor like Notepad++ (for Windows), TextWrangler (for Mac), or whatever is your preference.
	2) Use that text editor to replace all occurrences of \" with "
	3) Copy and paste that newly edited text into the website [https://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html] to format it nicely.
	4) Grab that newly formatted code and paste it back into your text editor to make whatever adjustments you want.
	5) Once you've made your updates, go ahead and replace all occurrences of " with \" so we can start to get everything back into a string format
	6) Copy and paste everything into the website [https://www.textfixer.com/tools/remove-line-breaks.php] to remove all line breaks from the code
	7) Go back to [https://caterpillarscount.unc.edu/php/orm/mailing.php] and put your new HTML string wherever you are making this adjustment (don't forget to add the string's encompassing quotations back if you deleted them).
